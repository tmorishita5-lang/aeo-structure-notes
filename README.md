# AEO / HERO / HELP Structure Notes

This repository documents **working hypotheses and evolving frameworks**
about information evaluation in the AEO / LLMO era.

- These notes are **not final answers**.
- Definitions and structures may change.
- Some concepts are intentionally left open-ended.

The goal is not to declare correctness,
but to **design evaluation axes** that can be reused, questioned, and revised.
